# Ensure Playwright browsers are installed after package install
# Add this as a post-install step using pip's "playwright install" command
# You can use a requirements.txt with a pip "extra" like below:

# Install all Python packages
# Then install Playwright browsers automatically
# This works with pip >= 22.0

# After pip install -r requirements.txt, run:
# python -m playwright install

# For full automation, create a setup.bat file:
# setup.bat
# -----------------
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# python -m playwright install
# -----------------

# Now, on each worker, just run setup.bat once, then run your scraper_worker.py
